# {{PROBLEM}} Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can record my experiences
I want to keep a regular diary

As a user
So that I can reflect on my experiences
I want to read my past diary entries

As a user
So that I can reflect on my experiences in my busy day
I want to select diary entries to read based on how much time I have and my reading speed

As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to keep a todo list along with my diary

As a user
So that I can keep track of my contacts
I want to see a list of all of the mobile phone numbers in all my diary entries

## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_

```

```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```python

class Organiser:
    #user facing properties:
        # diary_entries: list to contain diary entries
        # tasks: list to contain tasks
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def add_diary_entry(self, diary_entry):
        #parameters:
            #diary_entry - an instance of the DiaryEntry class
        #side-efefcts:
            #adds entry to lsit of diary entries
    
    def read_diary_entries(self):
        #returns:
            #list of added diary entries
    
    def read_entries_based_on_time(self, time, reading_speed):
        #parameters:
            #time - integer representing number of minutes
            #reading_speed - in representing words per minute
    
    def add_task(self, task):
        #parameters:
            #task - instance of Task class
        #side-effects:
            # adds task to tasks
    
    def see_tasks(self):
        #returns:
            #list of added tasks
    
    def see_phone_book(self):
        #returns:
            #list of phone numbers found in diary entries
    

class DiaryEntry:
    #user facing properties:
        #string representing a diary_entry
    
    def __init__(self, diary_entry):
        #parameter:
            #diary_entry - string representing a diary entry
    
    def count_words(self):
        #returns:
            #integer representing number of words in diary_entry

class Task:
    #user facing properties:
        #string representing task to do
    
    def __init__(self, task):
        #parameter:
            #task - string representing task 



```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a library
When we add two tracks
We see those tracks reflected in the tracks list
"""
library = MusicLibrary()
track_1 = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track_2 = Track("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
library.add(track_1)
library.add(track_2)
library.tracks # => [track_1, track_2]
```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a track with a title and an artist
We see the title reflected in the title property
"""
track = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
