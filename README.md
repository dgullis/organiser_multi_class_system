### Hello

This project was completed on the Makers bootcamp.

Using TDD and OOP the brief was to design and create a multi class system against a user brief which contained multiple requirements.

A deisgn 'recipe' was first created.
Integrative and unit tests were written.
The program was built up gradually against the written tests.
Once all test were passed the code was refactored and comment were adedd to improve readability and understanding.
